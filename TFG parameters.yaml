#2. Intensity normalization:
  normalize: true
  normalizeScale: 100  # This allows you to use more or less the same bin width.

#3. Image discretization: How can we calculate a good binwidth? First, extract firstorder: Range from the dataset to analyze, and choose a binwidth so, that range/binwidth remains approximately in this range of bins.

  binWidth: 5

  # Mask validation:
  # correctMask and geometryTolerance are not needed, as both image and mask are resampled, if you expect very small
  # masks, consider to enable a size constraint by uncommenting settings below:
  #minimumROIDimensions: 2
  #minimumROISize: 50
